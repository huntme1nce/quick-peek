Market Share/Revenue Fractions - Use Numerical Format\na third of the market share → 1/3 of the market share\na quarter of the revenue → 1/4 of the revenue\n3. Ratio-Style Fractions - Use XX/XX Format\nFifty-fifty → 50/50\nSimilar instances: 80/20, 70/15/15, etc.\nContext example: \"It used to be 60/40. Now, it's half and half\" → \"It used to be 60/40.

      "i": "1. Mathematical Operations - Use + Symbol\nFor actual calculations and equations between numbers.\nExamples:\n\"10 ml plus 10 ml of a drug\" → 10 ml + 10 ml of a drug\n\"One plus one equals two\" → 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. Estimates/Approximations - Use + After Numbers\nWhen \"plus\" means \"or more\" or indicates minimum thresholds.\nExamples:\n\"seven point five plus years\" → 7.5+ years\n\"eight plus percent\" or \"eight percent plus\" → 8%+\n\"We expect eight percent plus growth\" → 8%+ growth\n\n3. Positive/Negative Numbers and Changes - Use +/- Before Numbers\nUse +/- symbols when:\n- Speakers explicitly say \"plus,\" \"minus,\" or \"negative\", “positive” before numbers\n- Reporting actual changes vs. baseline (increase/decrease)\n\nExamples:\n\"plus eight percent\" → +8%\n\"minus eight percent\" → -8%\n\"negative one\" → -1\n\n4. Plus or Minus - Use ± Symbol\nONLY when speakers explicitly say \"plus or minus.\"\nExamples:\n\"Plus or minus 75%\" → ±75%\n75% plus or minus → 75%±\n\n5. Contextual/Narrative Use - Retain as Words\nWhen \"plus,\" \"minus,\" \"negative,\" or \"positive\" are used in descriptive, conceptual, or narrative context.\nExamples:\n\"Revenue plus operating costs\" → Revenue plus operating costs\n\"The positive aspects of the merger\" → The positive aspects of the merger\n\"Give or take 20%\" → Give or take 20%\n\nKey Rule: Use symbols for mathematical or numerical contexts and directional changes. Use words when referring to descriptive or conceptual ideas.\nReminder: Extra zeroes beyond the decimal point can affect the perceived precision or implied accuracy of a figure—especially in financial transcripts. For example, 4.05 billion ≠ 4.050 billion. The latter suggests precision to the thousandth place, which may not be accurate.",
