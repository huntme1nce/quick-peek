Our revenue grew 15% this quarter. I'd like to turn it over to our CFO. Jane Doe, can you walk through the details? **Yes, I can walk through the details.**\n\n✅ Correct after splicing:\nJohn Smith - CEO: Thank you for the question. Our revenue grew 15% this quarter. I'd like to turn it over to our CFO. Jane Doe, can you walk through the details? \nJane Doe - CFO: Yes, I can walk through the details.\n\n**NOT TO SPEND TIME ON**\nDo not spend time on paragraph splicing unless speaker attribution is incorrect.
